                <h3>How does this all work?</h3>
                <p>FracSCAN technology uses our pressure-based fracture map computed with our patented data acquisition1
and processing2. The data source is a surface pressure gauge on a monitor well—established through isolation from prior stages—that records the poroelastic pressure response from a nearby treatment well during hydraulic fracturing. As the treatment well is fracked, our geoscientists and completion engineers identify and quantify the poroelastic signals from the monitor well’s measured pressure response.</p>
<p>We use the poroelastic signals to compute a simple, accurate, affordable pressure-based fracture map by matching the observed responses in the monitor well to a digital twin. The fracture map includes fracture half-length, height, asymmetry, and azimuth and how fast these dimensions grew.</p>
<p>You can switch the treatment wells and monitor wells and continue completions, capturing the pressure responses from those fractures. The data acquired with this novel approach is a collection of pressure responses between monitor and treatment stages with the relative locations of each stage pair.</p>
				<p>With FracSCAN technology, you can decide if or when you need to change the stimulation treatment—including stage length, cluster spacing, fluid volume, proppant size, and proppant volume—to match a development’s varying geology.</p>

                <p>Is fracking with slickwater better than crosslinked gel?<br>What is the effect of total fluid volume on treatment efficiency?</p>
                <img src="<?php echo get_template_directory_uri(); ?>/img/frac_0.png" alt="">
				<p>An Eagle Ford operator asked us to analyze the effects of several completion design changes across several wells in south Texas. The operator varied some completion parameters—fluid type, fluid volume, proppant loading, number of clusters, and stage length—as fracking proceeded on the pads. Because the goal was to optimize these parameters for future completion designs, the operator needed to understand the fracture geometry and the geometry differences as a parameter was changed.</p>
<p>The growth rate of the largest fracture showed that the crosslinked gel produced more linear fractures with lower cluster efficiency compared with the slickwater treatment that generated higher fracture complexity and improved cluster efficiency. With FracSCAN technology, the operator made an informed, better decision about the right treatment design for the optimal fracture geometry, fracture complexity, and cluster efficiency.</p>
